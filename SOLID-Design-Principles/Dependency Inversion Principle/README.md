DIP: 
states, 
    A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
    B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

simplified state:
    High-level component should not depend on low-level component
