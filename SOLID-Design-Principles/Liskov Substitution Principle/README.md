Liskov Substitution Principle:
    The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application


Scenario:

We need to make a Rectangle and Square class 

Square is a Rectangle so it should inherit from Rectangle.
There is should be a method to calculate area of concrete object using its dimensions.
